# International Girls in ICT (SADC Analytics)

##### 2021 Theme : Connected Girls creating brighter future

While girls across the world tend to outperform boys in reading and writing skills, they continue to be under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

Through International Girls in ICT Day, we work with partners build awareness about the gender digital divide, support technology education and skills training, and encourage more girls and young women to actively pursue careers in STEM.
